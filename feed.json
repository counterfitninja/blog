Unmined fixes this to some degree as it allows both Java and Bedrock Servers to either be viewed through a GUI or can produce a Web based map for deployment via a Web server. </p>\n<p>Once Unmined has created its map this uploaded to GitHub and then pushed to Cloudflares Static Website host which offers free Site hosting for static files. This process can be seen in more details on the GitHub Page. </p>",
